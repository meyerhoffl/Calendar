Calendar
===========

This is a Ruby project for the Nashville Software School.
The assignment was to write a program in Ruby that mimics the Unix program, Cal.

Currently, my program is printing individual months and full years that are identical to Cal.

Future goals for this project:
Refactor code to achieve greater efficiency and readability.
Enable program to take command line arguments properly for a single month or full year.
