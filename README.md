This is a Ruby project for the Nashville Software School. The end goal is to print a calendar.

Currently, my program is returning months that match the unix Cal program months. The list of cases that I am testing
for include:


Returning a header with the month and year

Returning a header with the week days

Returning the number of days in a month

Modifying Zellers congruence so that Saturday = 7 instead of 0

Returning a formatted month with the header with the month and year and the week days
